This software uses the STM ToF features (X-NUCLEO-53L1A1) with an STM32 NUCLEO 
F401RE board to recognize the obstacle in front of it. When the event happens 
the mp3 shield (DFPlayer, driven by an I2C protocol) is commanded to randomly play 
a song among those present on the sd card and triggers the relay to drive the led 
strip on the Christmas tree.  

Enjoy it and best whishes!!
