Note:
This App was specially written (using Mitt App Inventor) to control the STM32 Line Follower
robot. In the main menu it's possible to choose the demo to run (among three different ones available)
and rightly customize some parameters of the algorithms.
To install it, download the file on your Android mobile device and click to proceed with the installation.
Please note: to rightly work it's necessary to grant all permissions in the app settings.
