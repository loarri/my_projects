# my_projects
My eklectronics projects, using STM32 NUCLEO boards (usually F411RE or F401RE)



- PWM_reader_with_pulseIn: It is used to test the STM32 Nucleo board capability to read a PWM signal from an RC receiver
  
 - PWM_reader_with_Interrupts: It is used to test the STM32 Nucleo board capability to read a PWM signal from an RC receiver
